Check if an ssh key exists within the computer already.

Open the terminal

Enter (ls -al ~/.ssh) 

if there isn't one then one must be generated

Step 2:
Enter into the terminal (ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

this will create a new key

a line will appear asking you about where to save the file, (jsut press enter to accept the default location)

create a passcode of anything

Step 3: 
Enable the ssh-agent

(eval $(ssh-agent -s))

Step 4:
